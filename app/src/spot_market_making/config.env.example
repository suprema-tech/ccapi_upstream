# The code uses a simplified version of Avellaneda & Stoikovâ€™s inventory strategy. The market making buy/sell order price is
# controlled by SPREAD_PROPORTION_MINIMUM, SPREAD_PROPORTION_MAXIMUM, and the available base/quote capital via a linear
# relationship. The price moves from
# SPREAD_PROPORTION_MINIMUM to SPREAD_PROPORTION_MAXIMUM when the inventory moves from INVENTORY_BASE_QUOTE_RATIO_TARGET to
# one asset completely depleted. The market making buy/sell
# order quantity is controlled by ORDER_QUANTITY_PROPORTION and the available total capital.
